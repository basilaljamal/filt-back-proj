# filtbackproj

This is Python code for a very basic filtered backprojection algorithm used in CT and SPECT imaging. Effectively it's a port for MATLAB code generated by Waqas Akram, Steve Gee, Charles Gamiz, Christine Pan, and Justin Romberg which for the time being can be found here:

This code does not explicitly use Radon transform functions. In doing so perhaps it can be clearer to the user what operations are actually taking place in the reconstruciton process and allow the freedom to tinker with said operations.
